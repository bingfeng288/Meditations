Character and intellect: the two poles of our capacity; one without the other is but halfway to happiness. Intellect does not suffice, character is also needed. On the other hand, it is the fool's misfortune, to fail in obtaining the position. the employment, the neighbourhood, and the circle of friends that suit him.

2. 品性与智慧

品性与智慧，是组成人类才能的两个要素。要走向幸福生活，缺少哪一个都将半途而废。仅仅拥有智慧是不够的，还要有好的品性。蠢人的不幸，在于没有适合他的地位、职位、邻居与朋友圈子。
