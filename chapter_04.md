4. Knowledge and courage

Knowledge and courage are the elements of Greatness. They give immotality, because they are immortal. Each is as much as he knows, and the wise can do anything. A man without knowledge, a world without light. Wisdom and strength, eyes and hands. Knowledge without courage is sterile.

4. 有识亦应有胆

有识亦应有胆，这是成为伟人的要素。知识与勇气是不朽的，同样可使人不朽。懂得多少，便有多伟大；若你学识渊博，则无事不可为。一个人无知，正如世界没有光明。智慧与力量，就像双眼与双手。有识无胆者亦无所成。
